## Overview
I’m an Implementation, Integration, and Customer Success professional with experience leading **enterprise SaaS implementations**, supporting **integrations** (including Concur, SCIM, and SFTP roster automation), and driving **post-launch adoption** through structured onboarding and KPI tracking.

This is **not a software engineering portfolio**.  
This portfolio is designed to help **recruiters and hiring managers** understand how I run implementations, partner cross-functionally, and deliver outcomes after launch.

All examples are **sanitized, anonymized, and non-confidential**.

## What I Do
- Lead end-to-end onboarding from kickoff through launch  
- Partner with Sales, Product, Engineering, and Customer Success  
- Support integrations and system readiness  
- Drive adoption through enablement, communication, and metrics  
- Identify risk early and course-correct before escalation

## Featured Case Studies

### Enterprise Implementation — Uber for Business
**Problem:**  
Enterprise rollout required structured onboarding across multiple stakeholder groups, with adoption risk if sequencing and ownership were unclear.

**What I Did:**  
Led kickoff and discovery, defined rollout milestones, coordinated configuration and enablement, and maintained a weekly execution cadence to unblock risks early.

**Outcome:**  
Successful launch with clearer ownership, smoother rollout, and stronger early adoption.

---

### Concur Integration Rollout
**Problem:**  
Finance teams required clean expense reconciliation and reduced manual workflows.

**What I Did:**  
Aligned finance stakeholders on success criteria, coordinated integration readiness, supported testing, and guided post-launch monitoring.

**Outcome:**  
Improved reconciliation clarity and reduced post-launch confusion.

---

### SCIM / SFTP Roster Automation
**Problem:**  
Manual user provisioning created administrative overhead and access delays.

**What I Did:**  
Defined provisioning ownership, aligned required data fields, coordinated automation setup, and documented lifecycle expectations.

**Outcome:**  
Reduced manual admin work and improved access consistency.

---

### Post-Launch Adoption Recovery
**Problem:**  
Adoption slowed after launch, putting long-term program success at risk.

**What I Did:**  
Identified adoption drop-off points, delivered targeted enablement, and reset success milestones.

**Outcome:**  
Renewed adoption momentum and improved program confidence.
